# Face_Recognition
A Python-based Face Recognition System using OpenCV and face_recognition library. The project can detect and recognize human faces in real-time through a webcam or image input.

## 📌 Features  
- 👤 Real-time face detection & recognition  
- 📷 Dataset creation for new users  
- 🔄 Easy to scale for multiple faces  
- 🖼️ Displays recognized user’s name with bounding box  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, dlib, face_recognition  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Capture images of a person and store them in a dataset.  
2. Generate face encodings using the `face_recognition` library.  
3. Compare real-time webcam frames with stored encodings.  
4. Display the recognized user’s name with a bounding box.
